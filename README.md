Wingify Task1

	This is the basic project of Java, Testng and Selenium. I have tried to build a framework based on Page Object Model for basic web automation. The task sheet provided by Wingify is kept in the framework as 'Wingify Task Sheet_with_MT_questions'

Motivation

	I have created this project in reference to the task sheet provided by Wingify Recruitment team. I wanted to learn/brush up my Java concepts. So, that's why I have build this project on Java Selenium.
